Addon for [Simple Voice Radio](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-voice-radio) that lets you change the frequency and modulation of held transceivers with trigger commands

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/trigger frequency set [0-999]` | Sets the frequency |
| `/trigger frequency` | Resets the frequency |
| `/trigger modulation set [1\|2]` | Sets the modulation type: `1` for AM, `2` for FM |
| `/trigger modulation` | Toggles the modulation between AM and FM |

## Notes

This addon was originally created just for my server but I decided to share it in case others may find it useful

Feel free to suggest improvements, report bugs or request compatibility with other Minecraft versions
